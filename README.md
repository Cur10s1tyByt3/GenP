### 🔴 NOT Supported (may/may not work)

<details>
<summary><b>🚫 Incompatible Architectures</b></summary>

| Type | Examples | Why It Fails |
|------|----------|--------------|
| **ARM64** | Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite/Plus | GenP requires native x64 for low-level patching |
| **Copilot+ PCs** | Surface Pro 11, Dell XPS 13 (2024+), HP Elite Folio | Use ARM processors |
| **Windows on ARM** | All devices with Snapdragon processors | Emulation layer breaks patching |
| **x86 (32-bit)** | Old systems, legacy hardware | GenP only supports 64-bit |

**Technical Explanation:** GenP modifies binaries at a low level. Windows on ARM uses Prism emulation for x64 apps, which interferes with patching. Additionally, Adobe is transitioning to native ARM64 builds with no x64 binaries to patch.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🚫 Incompatible Operating Systems</b></summary>

| OS | Alternative Solution |
|----|---------------------|
| **macOS** (all versions) | Use [Zii](https://adobezii.com) or [Cmacked](https://cmacked.com) |
| **Linux** (Ubuntu, Kali, Arch, etc.) | No native solution available |
| **Windows 7/8/8.1** | Upgrade to Windows 10/11 |

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🚫 Modified Windows Editions</b></summary>

❌ **These Windows variants are NOT supported:**

- **LTSC** (Long-Term Servicing Channel) - Missing system components
- **IoT** (Internet of Things editions) - Stripped functionality
- **Tiny10/Tiny11** - Removed critical Windows features
- **GhostSpectre** - Heavily modified builds
- **Windows PE** (Preinstallation Environment) - Not a full OS
- **Debloated/Custom Builds** - Missing dependencies
- **Windows Insider Preview** - Unstable, no support

**Why?** GenP modifies applications directly, so all official system requirements apply. Modified Windows editions often lack necessary system libraries, registry entries, and services that GenP and apps depend on.

</details>

### ⚙️ Additional Requirements

- **Creative Cloud** must be installed from [Official website](https://creativecloud.adobe.com)
- **Antivirus exclusions** configured (GenP triggers false positives)
- **Dummy account** recommended (never use your primary account)
- **AGS (Genuine Service)** will be removed by GenP

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

### AI Features Require Genuine Subscription

<table>
<tr>
<th>❌ Does NOT Work</th>
<th>✅ Still Works</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

**Cloud-Based AI (Requires Subscription):**
- Generative Fill (Firefly mode)
- Firefly integration
- AI Background Removal (cloud)
- Neural Filters (cloud processing)
- Generative AI text effects (Illustrator)
- AI audio enhancement (Premiere/Audition)
- Content Credentials
- Creative Cloud Libraries sync

</td>
<td valign="top">

**Local AI/Traditional Tools:**
- Content-Aware Fill (non-Firefly mode)
- Sensei ML tools (local)
- Object Selection & Select Subject
- Sky Replacement
- Neural Filters (local models only)
- Traditional editing tools
- Most Photoshop features

</td>
</tr>
</table>

### Workarounds

<details>
<summary><b>🔧 Photoshop Remove Tool Workaround</b></summary>

In Photoshop, set Remove Tool mode to **"Generative AI Off"**. This reverts to Sensei (traditional machine learning) instead of cloud-based Firefly, allowing local processing.

**Note:** Illustrator, Premiere Pro, InDesign, Lightroom, After Effects, and Express do NOT offer Generative AI toggle options - their AI features are fully cloud-based and require subscriptions.

</details>

### Update Requirements

- Apps require **re-patching after every update**
- Creative Cloud may push updates automatically
- Always **keep GenP.exe** for future re-patches
- Updates occur monthly or bi-monthly
